# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO
Pet Shop

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO
A website that allows users to adopt pets and shop for pet food and toys.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO
The website will have webpages for home (main page), pets, pet products, services, and/or donation. For pet webpage, there will be description and picture for each pet. Some webpages will have buttons for users to click on to buy things, donate, and/or register to be a volunteer. We can have a chatbox for questions or buttons for users to create an account and sign in.   

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable - I am not going to combine the final project with another course

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable - 
Partner: Jenny Ni , Partner's email: tun48961@temple.edu, Partner's TA: Tamara Katic

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO - We will at least make 3 webpages: home, pets, and pet products. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO - Service webpage, Donation webpage

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO - Chat box, Login, and Sign Up, Graphic art.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
We need to learn html, css, maybe javascript, and maybe flask in python. We also need to research
what things people will buy for their pets, general cost of those things, general adoption fees, breeds of animals, etc. Jenny will start the wbsite and I will draw the background of the webpages and the anime or cartoon versions of the pets. I will then start coding with Jenny afterwards. Both of us can research the information that we need and share it with each other
